So, I wrote code to generate and push this data to the Capital One API. The code for this can be found in the github repo. Once this was done, I mulled over a few project ideas that could be made using this API and decided on a finance dashboard. Using Vite for the first time, I created a React project along with Daisy UI as my CSS library and went ahead with getting the API data on there to display to the user."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"-challenges-we-ran-into-",children:"\ud83e\udea8 Challenges we ran into \ud83e\udea8"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The Capital One Nessie API provides deposits and withdrawals separately.
