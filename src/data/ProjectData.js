FuTourist allows everyone to choose which planets they want to travel between and on which date. Then it gives users an option to book for multiple people by selecting the number of people travelling. It provides the user with three spaceship options - one being the cheapest and longest journey, one a little faster, and the final option being a private spaceship. Users can then make a payment on the app and ask for the details being sent to them via SMS.`,
