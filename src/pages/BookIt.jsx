                            Currently, we are surrounded by applications like
                            Zomato, Swiggy, Flipkart, etc., and have a lot of
                            these apps even installed on our phones. So the
                            thought behind this system was to make something
                            that would help teachers, students and even
                            outsiders. Now with the help of this system, we can
                            book our college Auditorium and Turf from anywhere,
                            without being present in college and without needing
                            to approach the administration too.

                            As this was my very first self-made complete MERN
                            stack project there were quite a few obstacles faced
                            while building it. One of the most difficult choice
                            I had to make was on the tech stack that I wanted to
                            use for the project. I had started with the idea of
                            using MERN stack but since I did not know much I
                            shifted my plan to using Firebase Functions and
                            Firestore. But I still wished to learn something new
                            while building this project so then thought, why not
                            use Amazon Web Services.
                            <br />
                            Once I shifted to AWS I realised that it was not
                            very easy to learn. It took me 2 tries to setup AWS
                            incognito for Authentication and after multiple
                            tries to setup REST API with AWS functions and
                            Storage bucket, I gave up. By then I had done a few
                            courses on Nodejs, one by Andrew Mead and had a
                            decent understanding of how I could build the
                            project using MERN stack. So finally, I shifted back
                            to using the MERN stack just this time it was
                            different as I actually was successful in building
                            the system.
