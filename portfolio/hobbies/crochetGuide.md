### Tips that helped me Crochet ðŸ§¶

I'm a left-handed crocheter, so the tips below are for left-handed crocheters. If you're right-handed, just reverse the directions.

:::tip
- I stumbled upon a real gem that made my crochet life so much easier â€“ adding a [stitch marker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Y5AauoQ-U) to the first stitch of each round. It's like a little crochet buddy helping me count stitches and close off rounds effortlessly. <b>Bonus tip:</b> pop in extra markers on the 10th stitch when the stitch count is playing hard to get!
- To keep things organised, I note down the stitch count for each round. It's like my crochet journal, complete with circles around any increases or decreases.
- For all my left-handed crochet pals out there, The Wobbles has this fantastic [YouTube playlist with all the common stitch tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEh6W6iC57uQOF1BYrkmBUbG88kmwB0Ag).
- Big love to Bella Coco too â€“ she's got a bunch of [leftie-friendly crochet projects waiting for you on her YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bellacococrochet).
- If your single crochet stitches aren't forming nice squares, it might be because you're accidentally skipping the first stitch right after a slip stitch and chain stitch.
