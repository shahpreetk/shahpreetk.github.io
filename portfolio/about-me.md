# About Me

## Fullstack Developer & Digital Artist

TLDR: Self-taught MERN Stack Developer (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), Ardent Kitty lover, Painter (Digital Art too!) and a Software Engineer ❤️

As a Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co., I apply my web development expertise and passion for learning new technologies to create innovative solutions for the financial industry. I work with a diverse and collaborative team of engineers, designers, and business analysts, using React.js, Java, JavaScript, CI/CD pipelines, and other tools to deliver high-quality products and services that meet the needs and expectations of our clients.

I have a strong academic background in computer science, having graduated with a Distinction in MSc. Computer Science from Newcastle University in 2022. During my studies, I gained valuable skills and knowledge in areas such as artificial intelligence, data science, software engineering, and human-computer interaction. I also participated in the Major League Hacking Fellowship Program in 2020, where I collaborated with other talented developers from around the world on various projects and challenges, enhancing my technical and interpersonal skills.

I am always eager to learn new things and challenge myself, both personally and professionally. I have held various positions of responsibility and leadership in social service organisations, such as Leo Club and National Service Scheme, where I contributed to various causes and initiatives, such as education, health, environment, and community development. I also enjoy painting and crochet, which allow me to express my creativity and color sense.
