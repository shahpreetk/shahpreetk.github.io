## 🛠 Built with 🛠

UI - The prototyping and designing of the website was done on Adobe XD.

Frontend:
 - The frontend of this journey planning system is made using the [Reactjs](https://react.dev/) UI library. It helps in making a single-page application (SPA) that ensures fast rendering.
 - The [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) Framework has been used for the styling of the web app.
 - To give the user a feeling of content being loaded, we show a loader using [react-loading-skeleton](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton)
 - The backend sends the data using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).
 - The state management of the user selections has been done using [React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks).

Backend - The back-end program is developed by using the framework of [Springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [myBatis](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/).

Database - The database is created on [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
