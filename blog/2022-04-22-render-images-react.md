Images stored in the public folder are served as static assets.

<!-- truncate -->

You can do so by following the instructions below:
1. Create a new folder in your public folder called ```assets``` or ```images```
2. Store all your images in this folder
3. In your component, you can directly type the following in the src attribute: ```/assets/<image_name>```
