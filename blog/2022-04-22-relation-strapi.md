#### How to display information of related child tables for the requested parent table in Strapi API?
Originally, when requesting a Strapi API endpoint, you can only get the information of the table you requested without the information of tables it is related to.

<!-- truncate -->

In order to get the details of tables joined to the requested table, you can try requesting the endpoint by using - ```http://localhost:1337/api/tablename?populate=*```

Example:
If you have a supplier to whom you owe many payments and wish to see the payments information in the supplier information, you can request this link -->
          ```http://localhost:1337/api/suppliers?populate=*```

So populate here, populates the API with relations, components or dynamic zones.
